    <h2>Food is  Love</h2><br><br>
    <p id="para">
      Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying unrealistically thin,
      or depriving yourself of the foods you love. Rather, it’s about feeling great, having more energy
      improving your health, and boosting your mood.

      Healthy eating doesn’t have to be overly complicated. If you feel overwhelmed by all the conflicting
      nutrition and diet advice out there, you’re not alone. It seems that for every expert who tells you a
      certain food is good for you, you’ll find another saying exactly the opposite. The truth is that while some
      specific foods or nutrients have been shown to have a beneficial effect on mood, it’s your overall dietary pattern
      that is most important. The cornerstone of a healthy diet should be to replace processed food with real food
      whenever possible. Eating food that is as close as possible to the way nature made it can make a huge difference
      to the way you think, look, and feel.

      While some extreme diets may suggest otherwise, we all need a balance of protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals in our diets to sustain a healthy body. You don’t need to eliminate certain categories of food from your diet, but rather select the healthiest options from each category.

      <b>Protein</b> gives you the energy to get up and go—and keep going—while also supporting mood and cognitive function. Too much protein can be harmful to people with kidney disease, but the latest research suggests that many of us need more high-quality protein, especially as we age. That doesn’t mean you have to eat more animal products—a variety of plant-based sources of protein each day can ensure your body gets all the essential protein it needs.

    <p id="para">
      <b>Fat</b> Not all fat is the same. While bad fats can wreck your diet and increase your risk of certain diseases, good fats protect your brain and heart. In fact, healthy fats—such as omega-3s—are vital to your physical and emotional health. Including more healthy fat in your diet can help improve your mood, boost your well-being, and even trim your waistline

    <p id ="para">
      <b>Calcium</b> As well as leading to osteoporosis, not getting enough calcium in your diet can also contribute to anxiety, depression, and sleep difficulties. Whatever your age or gender, it’s vital to include calcium-rich foods in your diet, limit those that deplete calcium, and get enough magnesium and vitamins D and K to help calcium do its job
